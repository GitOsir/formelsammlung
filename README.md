## About
This project was created as a school assignment with the goal of teaching two classmates the basics of programming and web development. I chose to use the Next.js framework to build a more efficient and visually appealing website. This project also marked my first experience with Next.js.

Currently, the content is limited, as the primary focus was on teaching the students how to program rather than creating a comprehensive collection of formulas. However, the project serves as a foundation that can be expanded upon in the future.

In addition to web development, I introduced them to the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that Node.js is installed.
   - Navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Run the project locally with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.
